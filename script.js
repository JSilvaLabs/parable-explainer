            title: "The Sower",
            text: "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places... Other seed fell among thorns... Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a cropâ€”a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. (Matthew 13:3-9 excerpt)",
            explanation: "This story uses a farmer scattering seeds to represent teaching God's message. The different types of soil show how people respond differently depending on their hearts and circumstances."

            title: "The Good Samaritan",
            text: "Jesus said: 'A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers... A priest happened to be going down the same road, and... passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite... But a Samaritan... took pity on him... went to him and bandaged his wounds... Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man...?' (Luke 10:30-37 excerpt)",
            explanation: "This story answers 'Who is my neighbor?'. It teaches that loving your neighbor means showing compassion and helping anyone in need, regardless of their background or social standing."
        },

            id: 2,
            title: "The Prodigal Son",
            text: "'There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.'... he set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth... But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him... 'For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate. (Luke 15:11-32 excerpt)",
            explanation: "This story illustrates God's immense joy and willingness to forgive and welcome back those who have strayed (sinned) but then turn back to Him with repentance."

Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.' (Matthew 13:31-32)",
            explanation: "This parable compares the Kingdom of God to a tiny mustard seed that grows into a large tree. It shows that God's kingdom starts small but will grow to become unexpectedly large and significant."
